# Color Combination Theories

This project evaluates color combinations based on different color theories.

## Technologies Used
- PHP

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script providing primary and secondary colors in hexadecimal format as command-line arguments.
   Example: `php init.php #ff0000 #00ff00`
   - The first argument represents the primary color.
   - The second argument represents the secondary color.

## Color Theories Evaluated
- **Complementary Colors Theory:** Evaluates the quality of a color combination by considering the contrast between two colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel.
- **Analogous Colors Theory:** Assesses the quality of a color combination by considering colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel, resulting in a harmonious effect.
- **Split-Complementary Colors Theory:** Determines the quality of a color combination by considering a base color and two colors adjacent to its complementary color.
- **Tetradic Colors Theory:** Evaluates the quality of a color combination by considering four colors that are evenly spaced on the color wheel, forming two complementary color pairs.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different color combinations using this tool!
